abstract: **Background** Understanding the mechanisms of microbiome assembly during host development is crucial for successful modulation of the gut microbiome in an attempt to regulate host health and growth. However, the constantly changing nature of the gut microbiota and previous incomplete characterization of the swine intestinal microbiome has likely contributed to inconsistent results in the regulation of host phenotype through microbial interventions as antibiotic alternatives. Previous cross-sectional comparisons or longitudinal investigations have examined large time intervals, which may overlook important dynamics of the swine gut microbiome that occur on a daily timescale. Detailed characterization of the swine gut microbiome through meta-analysis allows us to understand the dynamics of microbial community succession, as well as the transient and natural variations between timepoints and animals. **Results** A total of 3,313 fecal samples from 349 pigs covering 60 time points (from birth to market age) from 14 publications from 2019 to 2021 were included in this meta-analysis. Raw sequences were analyzed with QIIME2 (2021.11) and a closed-reference OTU picking approach was used. Alpha diversity, measured by Faith’s phylogenetic diversity, Pielou’s evenness, Shannon diversity index, and the number of observed OTUs, continuously increased during early stages of animal growth and increased more slowly in the following stages. Linear mixed-effects model indicated that pig age, rather than dietary treatment played the most important role in the progression of microbial diversity and richness. Beta regression analysis based on relative abundances revealed that more microbial taxa were recruited while fewer were excluded by the gut microbiome. The microbial community structure also changed significantly between days at early ages and became more similar as pigs aged, as revealed by beta dissimilarity or distance matrixes. Dirichlet multinomial mixtures analysis supported a gradient microbial cluster strategy in analyzing longitudinal pig fecal samples and we found that the samples from the growing and finishing periods clustered into 4 main groups while early samples spread into all 10 clusters. Random forest regression identified 30 OTUs as potential biomarkers in modeling the swine gut microbiome development and the prediction models performed better in early stages with highly variable community configurations. External validation proved the generalization and benchmarking role of our models in application to future microbiome studies conducted in suckling and weaning pigs. **Conclusions** Our study described the swine gut microbiome development at high resolution by combining multiple datasets. We observed an age-dependent assembly pattern of the swine gut microbiome with a developmental phase at early ages and a stabilization phase at later ages. Shorter time intervals and a wider range of data sources can provide a clearer understanding of the gut microbiota colonization and succession and their associations with pig growth and development. The rapidly changing microbiome of suckling and weaning pigs implies potential time targets for growth and health regulation through gut microbiome manipulation.
